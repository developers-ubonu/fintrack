# Use Case: Job Profitability Tracking

**(MVP Version 1.0)**

## Refined Description

### Overview
Track all income and expenses (including Contractor payments) related to a specific service job to determine profitability, enabling business owners to understand which jobs are most profitable and improve pricing decisions.

**(Non-Functional Requirement Note:** All profitability calculations presented to the user, particularly summary figures and list view indicators (REQ-JP-04), must be displayed quickly and efficiently. The system should feel responsive, potentially utilizing strategies like background processing or pre-computation where appropriate to meet performance expectations on mobile devices.)

**(Calculation Basis Note:** For MVP simplicity and alignment with common user cash flows, profitability is calculated on a cash/received basis.)

### Actors
- Primary: Business Owner
- Secondary: None

### Trigger(s)
- Business owner wants to check profitability of a specific job
- Business owner records a new expense or income for a job
- Business owner makes a payment to a contractor for a job
- Business owner generates financial reports for business analysis

### Pre-conditions
- User has an active FinTrack account
- One or more jobs exist in the system
- Client details are available (via UC-CM)
- Any job-related expenses are recorded (via UC-ME)
- Any contractor payments are tracked (via UC-CP)
- Any job-related income/payments are recorded (via UC-CT or UC-IG)

### Expected Outcome
Business owner gains a clear understanding of each job's financial performance with accurate profit calculation (based on recorded transactions and MVP calculation basis), enabling better business decisions related to pricing, service offerings, and contractor engagement.

### Primary Path
1. Business owner navigates to the job list view in the application
2. Business owner selects a specific job to view its details
3. The system displays job information including the client, service type, status, and dates
4. The system calculates and displays a **concise financial summary** for the job, focused on quick assessment, showing:
   - Total revenue (based on payments received)
   - Total Costs (Expenses + Contractor Payments)
   - Net profit calculation (Revenue - Total Costs)
   - Profit margin percentage (or 'N/A')
5. Business owner can view a detailed breakdown of all individual financial transactions (revenue, expenses, contractor payments) related to the job
6. Business owner can generate a basic profitability report for the job
7. Business owner can return to the job list view, which displays profitability indicators for all jobs

### Alternate Paths

#### A1: Profitability Tracking Without Contractor Payments
1. Follow steps 1-3 of the primary path
2. The system calculates and displays a simplified financial summary showing:
   - Total revenue (Received)
   - Total Costs (Expenses only in this case)
   - Net profit calculation (Revenue - Expenses)
   - Profit margin percentage (or 'N/A')
3. Continue with steps 5-7 of the primary path

#### A2: Profitability Recalculation After Job Completion
1. Business owner navigates to a completed job in the job list
2. Business owner discovers and records a new expense related to the job
3. System prompts to associate the expense with the completed job
4. System recalculates the job profitability with the new expense included
5. System updates the profitability report and financial summary

#### A4: Accessing Profitability Data When Offline
1. Business owner attempts to access job details while device is offline
2. System displays **cached, potentially read-only** job information with a notification that data may not be current
3. System shows last-updated timestamp for the profitability data
4. System synchronizes and updates calculations when connectivity is restored

### Exception Paths

#### E1: Missing Expense Data
1. Business owner views a job's profitability report
2. System detects that one or more expenses are known but not yet recorded in the system
3. System displays a warning that profitability calculation may be incomplete
4. System provides an option to add missing expenses directly from this view
5. After adding missing expenses, the system recalculates profitability

#### E2: Expenses Without Job Association
1. System detects expenses that could be related to jobs but have no job association
2. System provides a notification in the job profitability view
3. Business owner reviews unassociated expenses
4. Business owner can associate relevant expenses to the job
5. System recalculates profitability with newly associated expenses

#### E3: System Offline When Report Needed
1. Business owner attempts to generate a detailed profitability report while offline
2. System notifies that detailed reporting is **unavailable offline**.

#### E4: Partial Client Payments
1. Business owner records a partial payment for a job invoice
2. System calculates profitability based on the **default MVP cash/received basis**, reflecting actual payments received.
3. System clearly indicates the calculation basis (e.g., "Based on payments received") in the profitability report/summary.

#### E5: Tax Calculation Impact on Profitability
1. Business owner views profitability for a job that includes GST/QST
2. System detects that tax calculations affect the profitability view
3. System displays profitability calculations **based on the default pre-tax view** and shows relevant tax figures (GST/QST collected/paid) separately for informational purposes.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-JP-01: Job Financial Summary Display

**Title:** Job Financial Summary Display

**Description:** The system must calculate and display a **concise** financial summary for each job, showing key profitability metrics based on recorded transactions. The primary goal of the summary is to provide the business owner with a quick, clear understanding of whether the job made money and identify significant profit deviations, enabling rapid assessment in the field.

**Actors:** Business Owner

**Trigger:** Business owner views a job's details

**Pre-conditions:**
- Job exists in the system
- Related financial transactions (if any) have been recorded

**Functional Steps (Happy Path):**
1. Retrieve all applicable revenue entries associated with the job
2. Retrieve all expense entries associated with the job
3. Retrieve all contractor payment records associated with the job
4. Calculate total revenue sum (**based on payments received** against associated invoices or directly recorded job income).
5. Calculate total expense sum
6. Calculate total contractor payment sum
7. Calculate **Total Costs** (Total Expenses + Total Contractor Payments)
8. Calculate net profit (Total Revenue - Total Costs)
9. Calculate profit margin percentage (Net Profit / Total Revenue Ã— 100%). **If Total Revenue is zero, the margin is considered Not Applicable ('N/A').**
10. Display the core financial summary prominently in the job details view

**Inputs:**
- Job ID

**Outputs / Expected Results (Core Summary Block):**
- Total revenue amount (formatted currency, indicating basis: '**Received**')
- Total Costs amount (formatted currency)

- Profit margin percentage (**or 'N/A' if revenue is zero**)
- Visual indicator of profitability status (e.g., color coding)
- Separate display area for relevant tax totals (GST/QST collected/paid) if applicable.
  **(Note:** Detailed expense breakdowns by category are available via transaction list or basic report).

**Error Handling / Alternate Flows:**
- If no financial data exists: Display zeros with a message indicating no financial data has been recorded
- If job is in progress: Display an indicator that profitability is preliminary
- If revenue is zero: Display profit margin as 'N/A'.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a job with recorded payments of $1,000, expenses of $300, and contractor payments of $400,
  When the business owner views the job details,
  Then the system displays revenue as $1,000 (Received), Total Costs as $700, net profit as $300, and profit margin as 30% in the main summary block.

- Given a job with recorded payments of $500 and expenses of $600 (no contractor payments),
  When the business owner views the job details,
  Then the system displays a negative profit of -$100 and provides a visual indicator showing the job is unprofitable.

- Given a job with no financial transactions,
  When the business owner views the job details,
  Then the system displays zeros for all financial fields and shows a message indicating no financial data has been recorded.
