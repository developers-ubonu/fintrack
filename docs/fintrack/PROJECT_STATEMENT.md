# Level 0: Problem Definition & User Needs Analysis - FinTrack

## Core Problem Statement
### Question 1: What is the core problem we're trying to solve?
**Answer:** Small landscaping and lawn care business owners struggle to track job profitability, manage seasonal cash flow, organize expenses, and handle client invoicing efficiently, leading to financial uncertainty and administrative burdens that take time away from their core work.

**Evidence:** Direct feedback from landscaping business owners, industry surveys showing high administrative burden in small service businesses, high failure rate of small trade businesses due to financial mismanagement.

**Assumptions Made:**
- [x] Target users have low to moderate financial expertise

- [x] Most users currently use inadequate tools (spreadsheets, paper, generic software)

**Information Gaps:**
- [x] Exact percentage of time spent on financial management vs. core work
- [x] Quantified financial impact of poor job cost tracking
- [x] Regional variations in financial management needs (Quebec-specific requirements identified)
- [ ] Integration requirements with existing tools
- [ ] User price sensitivity and willingness to pay for different feature tiers
- [ ] Specific accessibility requirements for field conditions

**Validation Required:**

- Subscription-based pricing model preferred
- Potentially tiered based on clients/jobs tracked or feature access
- Freemium approach possible (core tracking free, premium features paid)

**Budget Approach:**
- Cost-effective development with focus on core functionality
- Strict prioritization of MVP features
- Limited scope for "nice-to-have" features in initial release
- Need to balance development investment against potential market returns
