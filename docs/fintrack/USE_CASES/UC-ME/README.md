# Use Case: Mobile Expense Tracking

*(Version 1.7: Added Deferred Processing alternate path and related requirements)*

## Refined Description

### Overview

The Mobile Expense Tracking use case enables business owners to quickly and accurately record business expenses while in the field using a combination of manual entry and automated features. The system leverages OCR technology to extract data from receipt images and uses contextual information to suggest relevant job associations. Users can split expenses across multiple jobs with an intuitive interface and optionally track tax details if the tax features are enabled. The system also supports a **Deferred Processing** workflow for quickly capturing receipts and completing details later.

### Actors

  - Primary: Business owner
  - Secondary: None

### Trigger(s)

  - User selects "Add Expense" function in the mobile application
  - User accesses "Expenses" section and initiates a new expense entry
  - User selects a "Draft Expense" to resume processing

### Pre-conditions

  - User is authenticated in the application
  - User has the necessary device permissions granted (camera)
  - User has at least one job created in the system for expense association (optional, as expenses can also be marked as general business expenses)

### Primary Path

1.  User opens the mobile app and selects "Add Expense" function
2.  User photographs a receipt using the device camera
3.  System processes the image with OCR and extracts Vendor, Date, and Amount information
4.  System displays extracted data for user confirmation/correction
5.  System suggests potential job(s) based on contextual information (GPS location, calendar entries, recent activity)
6.  User confirms the suggested job(s) or manually selects from a job list
7.  If multiple jobs are selected, system displays an expense allocation interface
8.  User allocates expense amounts across selected jobs using the interface (sliders, percentages, or direct amounts)
9.  User selects or confirms the suggested expense category
10. If tax features are enabled: System attempts to extract and display GST/QST amounts from the receipt
11. If tax features are enabled: User confirms or corrects tax information
12. User saves the expense record (REQ-ME-11)
13. System confirms the expense has been recorded and syncs when online (REQ-ME-12)

### Alternate Paths

#### A1: Manual Entry Without Receipt

1.  At step 2, user selects "Manual Entry" instead of taking a photo
2.  User manually inputs expense details (Vendor, Date, Amount) (REQ-ME-04)
3.  Flow continues from step 5 of primary path

#### A2: Offline Mode Operation

1.  System detects no internet connection at any point in the flow (REQ-ME-10)
2.  System notifies user of offline mode and explains limitations
3.  User proceeds with manual entry or photo capture (image stored locally, without real-time OCR processing) (REQ-ME-02, REQ-ME-04)
4.  User can select jobs from cached job list and enter basic information
5.  System saves expense data (potentially as a **Draft Expense** if required info missing) and receipt image locally (REQ-ME-13)
6.  System queues the expense for synchronization when connectivity returns (REQ-ME-10)
7.  When connectivity is restored, system processes any pending OCR tasks and updates records

#### A3: General Business Expense

1.  At step 6, user indicates the expense is not associated with any specific job
2.  System marks the expense as a "General Business Expense"
3.  Flow continues from step 9 of primary path (skipping allocation steps)

#### A4: Multiple Expense Entry Session

1.  After completing one expense entry (step 13), user selects "Add Another Expense" option from the confirmation screen (REQ-ME-12)
2.  System maintains context from previous entry where applicable (e.g., location for job suggestions)
3.  Flow restarts from step 2 of primary path

#### A5: Deferred Processing

This path allows the user to quickly capture initial expense information (e.g., a receipt image) and save it as a **Draft Expense**, postponing detailed steps for later completion via the expense management interface (UC-EL).

1.  User initiates expense capture (e.g., photo) (Step 1-2 of Primary Path).
2.  User opts to defer completion after initial capture/OCR attempt (e.g., selects a "Save Draft" option).
3.  System saves available information (e.g., image link, potentially basic OCR data if available) as an expense record with "Draft" status (REQ-ME-13).
4.  User exits the expense capture flow.

### Exception Paths

#### E1: OCR Processing Failure

1.  At step 3, system fails to extract data from the receipt image
2.  System notifies user of the failure and provides troubleshooting tips (e.g., better lighting, different angle)
3.  User can retry photo capture (REQ-ME-02) or switch to manual entry (A1)

#### E2: Required Data Missing

1.  At step 12, system validates that minimum required fields are completed (REQ-ME-11)
2.  If validation fails, system highlights missing fields and prevents saving
3.  User completes required information and attempts to save again

#### E3: Expense Allocation Error

1.  At step 8, if the sum of allocated amounts does not equal the total expense amount
2.  System displays an error message and prevents proceeding (REQ-ME-07)
3.  User adjusts allocation until the sum matches the total expense amount

#### E4: Storage Limit Reached

1.  System detects local storage limit is approaching or reached
2.  System notifies user and suggests sync operation or cleanup options
3.  User takes appropriate action or proceeds with limited functionality

### Expected Outcome

Accurate expense records captured with minimal manual effort through automation features; expenses properly allocated to jobs or marked as general; **Draft Expenses saved for later completion when needed**; receipt images stored for reference; data synchronized between offline and online environments. If tax features are enabled, tax information is also accurately captured for future reporting.
