## Purpose
This document clearly defines the boundaries, constraints, and assumptions of the project to establish a shared understanding of what is and is not included in the solution. It serves as a reference point for scope management throughout the project lifecycle and sets realistic expectations for all stakeholders.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project boundaries are clearly defined and agreed upon
- [ ] In-scope and out-of-scope items are explicitly documented
- [ ] Key constraints are identified and analyzed
- [ ] Critical assumptions are documented and validated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria for minimum viable solution are established
- [ ] Phased implementation approach is outlined if applicable

## Content Requirements
1. Project Boundaries
2. In-Scope/Out-of-Scope Items
3. Key Constraints
4. Critical Assumptions
5. Minimum Viable Solution Definition
6. Future Phase Considerations

## Validation Methods
- [ ] Review with key stakeholders
- [ ] Consistency check with Problem Statement and User Needs
- [ ] Verification of alignment with project goals
- [ ] Assessment of scope feasibility
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off
