### 1. Project Boundaries *(Revised Section)*

#### 1.1 Solution Scope
FinTrack is a financial management application specifically designed for small landscaping, lawn care, and related service businesses (e.g., snow removal, cleaning) in Quebec. The solution focuses on providing **effortless** core financial tracking features essential for these businesses, including **automated expense capture via OCR**, context-aware job suggestions, simple expense splitting, job profitability tracking, client management, basic contractor management (add/edit/view/track payments), invoicing, and Quebec-specific tax handling (GST/QST calculation and informational guidance). The solution will not address comprehensive accounting needs, payroll processing, or detailed scheduling/dispatching functionality in the MVP.

#### 1.2 User Scope
The solution targets three primary user personas:
- Solo Operators (individuals who handle all aspects of their business themselves)
- Small Crew Owners (businesses with 2-10 employees or contractors)
- Prospective/Early-Stage Operators (individuals planning to start or who recently started a service business)

The solution does not target medium or large enterprises, franchises, or businesses significantly outside the field service industry focus in the initial phases.

#### 1.3 Functional Scope *(Revised Section)*
The functional scope includes:
- User account settings and basic business profile

#### 1.5 Organizational Scope
The solution impacts the core financial management processes of small service businesses, including:
- Expense tracking and categorization (**streamlined via automation**)
- Revenue tracking and client management
- Job costing and profitability analysis
- Tax management (GST/QST calculation, reporting preparation, informational guidance)
- Invoice generation and payment tracking (client payments)
- Contractor payment tracking (**with allocation**)
