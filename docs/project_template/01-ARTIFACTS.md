## Rules for Artifact Development
1. No artifact can be started without all its dependencies being completed
2. Each artifact must be validated before being considered complete
3. Changes to an artifact require review of dependent artifacts
4. Cross-cutting artifacts must be updated when any artifact is modified
5. Each artifact must include:
   - Version number
   - Last updated date
   - Status (Draft/Review/Approved)
   - Owner
   - Reviewers
   - Change log

## Validation Requirements
1. Each artifact must be reviewed by:
   - Technical stakeholders
   - Business stakeholders
   - End-user representatives (where applicable)

2. Validation methods include:
   - Peer reviews
   - Stakeholder workshops
   - User testing (where applicable)
   - Expert reviews

## Implementation Readiness Assessment
Before proceeding to implementation, verify that:
1. All requirements have corresponding specifications
2. All specifications have acceptance criteria
3. All test cases trace to specifications
4. All specifications trace to implementation components
5. All critical issues and gaps are addressed

See [Traceability and Specification Gaps](../TRACEABILITY_AND_SPECIFICATION_GAPS.md) for a detailed analysis of potential issues and solutions in the artifact chain.
