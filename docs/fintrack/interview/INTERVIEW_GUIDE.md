# Interview Guide for Landscaping Business Owners

## Purpose
This interview guide is designed to collect critical information from landscaping business owners in Quebec to inform the development of FinTrack. The data collected will feed directly into our remaining Level 0 artifacts (Problem Domain Model and Scope Definition Document) and provide foundational information for Level 1 artifacts.

## Interview Logistics
- **Duration:** 45-60 minutes
- **Format:** Video call or in-person meeting 
- **Recording:** Request permission to record for internal use only
- **Language:** Offer interviews in English or French based on participant preference
- **Participants:** 5-7 landscaping business owners in the Greater Montreal area
  - Mix of solo operators and small businesses with crews (1-10 employees)
  - Mix of businesses that do/don't offer snow removal services

## Post-Interview Analysis Protocol
After each interview, document:

1. Key insights that validate or challenge existing assumptions
2. New requirements or considerations discovered
3. Specific impact on each of our artifacts:
   - Problem Domain Model updates needed
   - Scope Definition adjustments required
   - Business Case implications
   - Stakeholder Requirements additions

## Traceability Protocol
For each significant finding from the interviews, record:
1. Which interview/participant provided the insight
2. Which artifact(s) need to be updated as a result
3. Specific changes required to those artifacts

This ensures we can trace every requirement back to actual user needs and maintain alignment throughout the project.
